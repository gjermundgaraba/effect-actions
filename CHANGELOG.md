# Changelog

## 0.6.0

Built and tested against `effect` and `@effect/platform-node` `4.0.0-rc.117`. The `effect`
peer range is unchanged (`>=4.0.0-rc.116 <4.0.0`).

### Breaking changes

**MCP is 2026-07-28 only.** `ActionMcp.layerHttp` and `ActionMcp.layerStdio` no longer take
`protocols`; both serve `McpProtocol.v2026_07_28` and nothing else. Over HTTP the endpoint is
stateless: no `initialize` handshake and no session. A 2025-era client (one that opens with
`initialize`) is refused: over HTTP with status 400 and JSON-RPC error `-32020`, over stdio with
JSON-RPC error `-32022` on `initialize`. Stdio hosts must speak 2026-07-28. Without a
session, `notifications/cancelled` interrupts nothing over HTTP.

- Migrate: delete `protocols` from every `layerHttp`/`layerStdio` call, and delete local
  protocol lists (`[McpProtocol.v2026_07_28]` and the four-revision stdio lists). Clients
  must speak 2026-07-28; pin the official client with
  `versionNegotiation: { mode: { pin: "2026-07-28" } }`.

**`TestingClient.withMcpClient` has no `versionNegotiation` option.** It always pins
2026-07-28, the one revision served.

- Migrate: delete `versionNegotiation` from `withMcpClient` options.

**A group's `schemaError` policy states two answers; the library chooses between them.**
`{ errors, map }` is replaced by `{ invalid: { schema, make }, internal: { schema, make } }`.
A native `HttpApiSchemaError` from decoding the request (`Payload`, `Params`, `Headers`,
`Query`) is answered by `invalid`; one from encoding the handler's result (`Body`,
`ResponseHeaders`) by `internal`. `make` receives the failure and returns its schema's value.
`ActionGroup.SchemaErrorPolicy` now takes `<Invalid, Internal>` codecs instead of an error
tuple, `ActionGroup.SchemaErrorAnswer` is new, and a group's third type parameter is the union
of its policy's error codecs rather than a tuple.

- Migrate:

  ```ts
  // before
  const schemaError = {
    errors: [InvalidInput, InternalFailure],
    map: (failure: HttpApiError.HttpApiSchemaError) =>
      failure.kind === "Body" || failure.kind === "ResponseHeaders"
        ? new InternalFailure({ message: "The response could not be encoded." })
        : new InvalidInput({ message: failure.cause.message }),
  };

  // after
  const schemaError = {
    invalid: {
      schema: InvalidInput,
      make: (failure: HttpApiError.HttpApiSchemaError) =>
        new InvalidInput({ message: failure.cause.message }),
    },
    internal: {
      schema: InternalFailure,
      make: () => new InternalFailure({ message: "The response could not be encoded." }),
    },
  };
  ```

  A `make` that reads its failure needs the parameter annotation in a standalone constant
  (inline in `ActionGroup.make` it is inferred). Policies that branched on
  `kind === "Payload"` answered `Params`, `Headers` and `Query` as internal; those kinds never
  occur on action routes, so nothing observable changes.

**`implement` refuses a handler record that lacks an action.** A plain record throws at
`implement`; a builder Effect's record fails the adapter layer's build. Before, the missing
handler was a defect on the first request for that action. The message is now
`Missing handlers for group "<group>": <actions>`. Every adapter also selects its handlers
once, when it builds, rather than per request.

- Migrate: nothing, unless a record was deliberately incomplete; the types already required
  every handler.

### Additions

- `ActionMcp` options are the native `McpServer.layerHttp` / `layerStdio` options minus
  `protocols`, passed through unchanged: `description`, `websiteUrl`, `icons` and `extensions`
  now reach the server.
- `Http.openApi(path?)`: the binding's OpenAPI document as one `GET` route, at
  `<apiPath>/openapi.json` unless a path is given. Replaces
  `HttpRouter.add("GET", "/api/openapi.json", HttpServerResponse.jsonUnsafe(OpenApi.fromApi(Http.api)))`;
  pass `"/openapi.json"` to keep a root path.
- `ActionHttpClient.promise(Http, { baseUrl?, token?, fetch? })`, a new subpath
  `@gjermundgaraba/effect-actions/ActionHttpClient`: `client.<group>.<action>(input)` for every
  HTTP-served action, resolving with the decoded success. It rejects with what the native
  `HttpApiClient` fails with: a declared error value (the action's, the policy's, or the
  binding's surface `errors`), a native `HttpClientError` (unreachable: `response` is
  `undefined`; or an undeclared status or unreadable body), or a `SchemaError`. `token` is sent
  as a bearer; `fetch` defaults to the global one, looked up per call; an omitted `baseUrl`
  keeps routes relative (the page's origin). It replaces hand-written wrappers of
  `Effect.runSync(HttpApiClient.make(...))`, `FetchHttpClient.Fetch`, a bearer
  `transformClient` and a `run` that re-throws failures; any classification of statuses into
  application errors stays with the caller. Other headers go through a wrapping `fetch`.
- `Testing.mcpCall(handler, { url, name, arguments?, headers? })`: one stateless `tools/call`,
  resolving with `{ isError: false, value }` (the `{ value }` envelope removed) or
  `{ isError: true, error }` (the error text, parsed as JSON when it is a declared error). It
  throws for a non-200 answer or a JSON-RPC error; `mcpRequest` still covers those. It replaces
  test helpers that parse the JSON or event-stream body and unwrap `structuredContent.value` or
  the `isError` text.

### Effect 4.0.0-rc.117

rc.117 generates MCP tool `outputSchema` differently (a top-level `$ref` is inlined). Every
effect-actions tool output is rooted at its `{ value }` object, so published tool schemas are
unchanged.
